# Welcome!

Welcome! You've arrived at our Contributing page and are now one step away from joining our quest to make coding more
fun. We're thankful for all your contributions, whether it's helping us find issues in our code, highlighting features
we're missing, or contributing to the codebase. If you've found your way here, you'll soon be ready to join in the fun
of building features and fixing bugs directly with us - and we're thrilled to have you on board!
